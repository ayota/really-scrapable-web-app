		<h2>Challenge Five: Pull from some APIs!</h2>
		<p>Scraping is fun, but sometimes firing up Beautiful Soup isn't the best way to get the information you need. Some sites have APIs - handy little tools that make interoperability between applications easy - and allow the public to access them. This site has an API which does exactly one thing. It serves up information about the current Australian prime minister. You have a choice of scraping from a JSON or an XML api. You get bonus points if you scrape both.</p>
